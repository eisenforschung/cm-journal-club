We looked at the spin-dynamics with longitudinal fluctuations as described in [this paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.86.054416). At the end of the paper, we figured out that there are still a few questions remaining, in particular:

- What are the numerical parameters to be chosen, such as time discretization?
- How to determine the physical parameter gamma_s, which accunts for the unit of time? Does it tell us something about the magnetic dynamics?
- How does it compare with other spin dynamics codes, and how does it compare with Monte Carlo?

All these points are crucial, because depending on the understanding we can gain, there's a real possibility that we're going to include it as a new pyiron module.
