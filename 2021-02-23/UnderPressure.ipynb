    "# Does this break Markov-Chain Properties?\n",

    "where $p_0$ is the pressure that stabilizes the system at the target volume $V_0$ (modulo prefactors, signs, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a linear dependency on $\\Delta V$ this is in fact equivalent to the feedback approach.  Consider e.g. that the system starts the simulation at $p_0$, $V_0$ and the next step is a volume rescaling step to the volume $V^\\prime$.  If it is accepted the new volume is $V^\\prime$.  In the feedback scheme the new pressure and volume would be $p_0 + \\alpha \\frac{V_0 - V^\\prime}{V_0}$, $V_0$ where as in the modified scheme it would be $p_0 - B (V_0 - V^\\prime)$, $V^\\prime$.  After accepting consider a possible step back to $V_0$, both schemes would update the pressure to $p_0$.  Identifying $\\alpha = -B V_0$, shows that both schemes would update the pressure identically and hence would also follow the same acceptance probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $p(V)$ is not linear, but the feedback is small this argument still holds as we may locally approximate $p(V)$ linearly.  The advantage of the feedback scheme is then that know a-priori knowledge of $p_0$ or $p(V)$ is needed.  As pointed out in the discussion picking a feedback value that is too large voids this argument."
